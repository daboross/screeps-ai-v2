# screeps-v2

My version 2 code for the JavaScript-based MMO game, screeps.com

This was initially a line-for-line rewriten of the JavaScript version 1 in Python. However, the goal is to transition
into a more OO-based model, with less repeated calculations for similar tasks, more caching, and easier to read code
using Python's @property members for memory access.
